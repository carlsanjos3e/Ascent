This is a repository for the "Ascent" website. A website made to advertise the fictional game "Ascent" as our output for the course, Applications Development and Emerging Technologies.

My role in the development of this website was primarily in back-end development. This project introduced me to JavaScript, and I applied my knowledge of PHP and SQL.
