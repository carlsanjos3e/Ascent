This is a repository for the "Ascent" website. A website made to advertise the fictional game "Ascent" as our output for the course, Applications Development and Emerging Technologies.

My role in the development of this website was primarily in back-end development. This project introduced me to JavaScript, and I applied my knowledge of PHP and SQL.

My proudest work on this project was my contribution to the "Guides" page and the "Shop" page. Primarily as part of the development of the HTML/CSS layout of the pages and in the interactions between user and elements.

All the designs and world-building were done by my groupmates. To whom most of the credit for the completion of this project goes to. This website, and the entirety of Ascent, would not be what it is without them. Meja, Yesha, Gessa, and Maxine.
